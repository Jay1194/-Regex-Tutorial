# Welcome To My Tutorial On Regex

In this tutorial I will be giving a walk through on the functions and expressions of (Regex) also known as Regular Expression.This works well for extracting data from a specific body of code and can also be used as a validation tool. A regular expression (Regex) is a group of characters that, when used in a search algorithm or code, defines a particular type of search pattern.Regex can be used any time to query string-based data such as: Parsing user input, Examining server or program logs, Analyzing command line outputs, Handling text files with a consistent syntax,  Searching and refactoring code and more!

## Summary

Today we will take a look at the components of a regular expression or (REGX) used when matching a Email Address. In an email address each chararcter has a set responisbility to validiate that the user is entering an email address in the correct format. The Email Address REGX looks like this: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ and if your wondering how this all works 
when it comes to email adresses the REGX is searching for two things one being the "@" and after that the "domain" example: gmail.
